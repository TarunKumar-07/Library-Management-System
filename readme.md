# Library Management System

Welcome to the Library Management System project! This application allows users to manage books, patrons, and transactions for a library system. This project is divided into two main parts: the backend (server) and the frontend (client).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
- **MongoDB**: Ensure MongoDB is installed and running on your machine. You can download it from [MongoDB official website](https://www.mongodb.com/).

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of the project up and running, follow these simple steps:

### 1. Clone the repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/library-management-system.git
```
````

### 2. Install Dependencies

You need to install dependencies for both the backend and frontend. Follow these steps:

#### Backend

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install the backend dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

#### Frontend

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. Install the frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### 3. MongoDB Server

Ensure that your MongoDB server is running. You can start it by using the command:

```bash
mongod
```

### 4. Run the Application

After installing all dependencies and ensuring MongoDB is running, you can start the application:

#### You can run both(Frontend & Backend) at a time

1. In main directory open cmd and run the command :
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

#### You want to run only Backend

1. Navigate back to the backend directory:

   ```bash
   cd ../backend
   ```

2. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

#### You want to run only Frontend

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. Start the frontend server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### 5. Access the Application

Once both servers are running, open your web browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure that MongoDB is running. If not, you can start it with the command `mongod`.
- Check that all dependencies are installed correctly with `npm install`.
- If you encounter any issues, check the console output for errors and ensure all required software is up to date.
